Assessing the Impact of Lifestyle Choices on Diabetes Risk

Background:

Diabetes has become a significant public health concern, characterized by elevated blood sugar levels that can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Understanding the factors that contribute to diabetes risk is essential for effective prevention and management strategies. The dataset used in this analysis, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prosperchuks/health-dataset), encompasses a range of health and lifestyle variables, including age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and physical activity levels.

Objectives for Diabetes Risk Analysis Project:
This dataset provides a valuable opportunity to explore how various factors are associated with the likelihood of developing diabetes. By analyzing these variables, we aim to uncover critical patterns and relationships that can inform personalized healthcare strategies and public health interventions. The goal of this project is to leverage data-driven insights to enhance our understanding of diabetes risk factors, support preventive measures, and contribute to better management practices for individuals at risk.
